# SIP Continuity Discovery Engine Dashboard

An interactive discovery engine dashboard and research project analyzing why first-time mutual fund investors keep or stop their Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in their first year.

## Features

- **Overview Funnel & Findings**: Key metrics, 5-line summary, and data progression from 1.63M public records to strict early-journey episodes.
- **Nine Questions**: Interactive breakdown of investor motivations, expectations, check frequency, in-app friction, and continuation reasons with Wilson 95% confidence intervals on Kish effective sample sizes.
- **Opportunity Areas**: Quantitative analysis of five primary levers (Payment & AutoPay friction, Order/money status and support resolution, Returns expectations wobble, Cash-flow shocks, and SIP control).
- **Story Explorer**: Search and filter through thousands of early-journey investor stories with verbatim evidence quotes and grounded categorical spans.
- **AI Evidence Log**: Full audit log detailing corpus coverage, held-out golden set evaluation, Sonnet and cross-family reliability audits, and transparent reporting of corrected/rejected AI prompts and outputs.
- **Try the Engine**: Interactive test interface allowing live or cached analysis of investor texts with grounded extraction.

## Privacy & Safety Rules

1. **No Personal Data**: Usernames are dropped at ingestion; author identity is hashed using HMAC-SHA256 with a local secret salt (`author_hash`).
2. **PII Scrubbing**: Every text and title is passed through `common/scrub.py` before persistence.
3. **No Raw Data Committed**: Raw, interim, and personal data directories are strictly gitignored.
4. **Polite Client**: All network traffic respects rate pacing, exponential backoff, and robots.txt. No CAPTCHA bypassing or unauthorized site scraping.
